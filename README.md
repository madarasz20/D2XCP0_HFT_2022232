1. Client Layer
The client layer is responsible for handling user interfaces and user interactions. It is the outermost layer of the application.

2. Application Layer
The application layer contains the core logic and acts as an intermediary between the client and data layers.

3. Data Layer
The data layer is responsible for data storage and management.

4. Test Layer
Throughout the application, testing processes ensure that the application layer functions correctly and meets its requirements.
